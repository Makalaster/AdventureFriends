1. Title - Research for Mobile Tabletop RPG

2. Authors and stakeholders - Sam Perlow - Lead developer, perlow.sam@gmail.com

3. Date - May 10, 2017

4. Background - For my final project with General Assembly, I have chosen to create an app that replicates the functionality of a traditional tabletop role playing game, but in a mobile format. The standard setup for such a game involves a lot of organization and materials. Being able to replace much or all of this with a digital experience could enhance gameplay.

5. Goals - Create an experience that enhances or replaces the traditional tabletop RPG setup.

6. Research questions - What are current gripes with playing a traditional TTRPG?
What do people like about the current setup?
How do people prepare for a game or session?
What equipment is needed to play?
How do people stay organized during play and in between sessions?
How many people typically are involved?
What are hurdles to getting a game going?
What prevents people from playing more often?
Is being in physical space together necessary?

7. Methodology - I will send out a google forms survey that people can answer when they are ready.

8. Participants - People with whom I have played board games or people I know regularly play board games. They may have expressed issues with getting games going and want to play more, but for various reasons have not been able to.

9. Schedule - Start: May 10, 2017; Study: May 10, 2017; Results: May 11, 2017

10. Script - Equipment
What equipment or supplies are necessary for any given game?
Setup

Likes
What do you like about the traditional play experience?
Hurdles
What prevents you from playing more often?
Groups
How many people are in a typical play group?

#### Research Highlights
##### Observations
DMs tend to create a loose structure, then fill in details as they go. They tend to react to the players as much as the players react to the DM.
Only one person played more than once a month.

##### Insights
People like to be imaginative and creative. They like problem solving in real time and hanging out with friends.
The main issue with being able to play is getting people together and keeping a consistent schedule.
Everyone needs dice, character sheets, pencils, reference materials.
Groups are usually around 4-5 people.

##### Design Recommendations
Keep things organized.
Include some sort of scheduling functionality.
Allow for creativity and problem solving.

##### New topics or open questions to research further
Potential asynchronous play?
Voice/video chat?

#### User Personas
##### Sketch, bio, demographics
Late 20s
Live in cities
Busy lives
Played more games in the past
Enjoy hanging out with friends

##### Behaviors and Habits
Review previous game sessions.

##### Stories, Scenarios, and Frustrations
Most current digital aides or alternatives for ttrpgs are as much of a hindrance as they are a help.

##### Needs/Problems/Goals
Stay organized.
Enable planning.
Allow for more frequent play.
Reduce amount of "stuff" needed to play.

#### Problem Statement
##### How might we?
How might I enable users to play more often?
How might I facilitate planning or lowering barriers to play?
How might I enable more organization?
How might I allow game setup to take less time and preparation?

##### Problem Statement
My user base needs a way to play more regularly, because it is difficult as an adult to get a group of people together on a regular basis with so much necessary planning involved.

##### Hypothesis
I believe that by creating an app that allows for simultaneous remote play in addition to enhancing local play, for adult ttrpg players I will achieve a smoother, more regular experience. I will know this to be true when I can test the game with friends and we can play several sessions.
