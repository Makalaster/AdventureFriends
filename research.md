1. Title - Research for Mobile Tabletop RPG

2. Authors and stakeholders - Sam Perlow - Lead developer, perlow.sam@gmail.com

3. Date - May 10, 2017

4. Background - For my final project with General Assembly, I have chosen to create an app that replicates the functionality of a traditional tabletop role playing game, but in a mobile format. The standard setup for such a game involves a lot of organization and materials. Being able to replace much or all of this with a digital experience could enhance gameplay.

5. Goals - Create an experience that enhances or replaces the traditional tabletop RPG setup.

6. Research questions - What are current gripes with playing a traditional TTRPG?
What do people like about the current setup?
How do people prepare for a game or session?
What equipment is needed to play?
How do people stay organized during play and in between sessions?
How many people typically are involved?
What are hurdles to getting a game going?
What prevents people from playing more often?
Is being in physical space together necessary?

7. Methodology - I will send out a google forms survey that people can answer when they are ready.

8. Participants - People with whom I have played board games or people I know regularly play board games. They may have expressed issues with getting games going and want to play more, but for various reasons have not been able to.
